# Diabetic_Prediction
This project implements and evaluates machine learning models to predict diabetes onset using the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset. Focusing on medical diagnostic priorities, we explore data preprocessing (log transformations, standardization), feature selection (RFE), and model training with Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifiers.
